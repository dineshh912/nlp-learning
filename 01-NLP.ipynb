    "    We talk with smart assistance such as amazon alxa, google home, pple siri to do many of our day to day tasks. we talk to these assistents not in a programming languages, but in our natural language. Natural language is primary medium of communication since the beginning. but computers can only process data in binary. In the area of computer science that deals with methods to analaze, model and understand human language.\n",

    "### Application using NLP\n",
    "    * Email platform such as Gmail use NLP toprovide range of features, such as spam classification, priority inbox, calendar event, auto complete etc.,\n",
    "    * Voice based assistents - Interact with user, understand user commands\n",
    "    * Search engines - Query understanding, query expansion, question answering,information retrival\n",
    "    * Machine Translation - Google translate, amazon translate etc.,\n",
    "    * Analyze social media feed to understand customer voice.\n",
    "    * E commerce - Extracting relavent information, understanding user reviews\n",
    "    * Automatic report generaion.\n",

    "### Language\n",
    "    Language is a structured system of communication that involves complex combinations of its components such as characters, word, sentences etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Human language composed of four major building blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Phonems - speech and sounds ( speech to text, speaker identification, text to speech )\n",
    "        * Morphemes and lexemes - Words ( Tokeniztion, word embeddings, POS Tagging )\n",
    "        * Syntax - Phrases & sentences ( Parsing, Entity extraction, relation extraction )\n",
    "        * context - meaning (Summarization, Topic modeling, sentiment analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phonems\n",
    "    Phonems are the smallest unit of the sound in a language. They may not have any meaning by themselves but can induce meanings when uttered in combination with other phonems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Morphemes and lexemes\n",
    "    Morphemes is the smallest unit of the language that has a meaning. It formed by combination of phonemes. Not all morphemes are words but all prefix and suffix are morphemes. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Lexemes are the structural variation of morphemes related to one another by meaning. Ex Run and running belong to the same lexeme. lexeme is a foundation block for many nlp tasks such as tokenization, stemming, word embeddings, POS tagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax\n",
    "    Syntax is a set of rules to construct grammatically correct sentences out of words and phrases in a language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "    Context is how various parts in a language come together to convey a particular meaning. The meaning of a sentence\n",
    "    can change based on the context, as words and phrases can sometimes have multiple meanings. generally context composed of sematic and pragatics. sematic is the direct meaning with out external context. pragmatics adds world knowledege and external context of the conversation to enaable us to infer implied meaning. (sarcasm detection, summarization, topic modeling)"

    "### Why is NLP Challenging?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The ambiguity and creativity of human language are just two if the characteristics that make nlp more challenging. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ambiguity of Language\n",
    "    Uncertainity of meaning. most human languages are inherently ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * \"i made her duck\" - This sentence have mulitple meaning based on the context. \n",
    "    * “He is as good as John Doe.” - Figurative languages increase the ambiguity\n",
    "\n",
    "### One of the key challenges in NLP is how to encode all the things that are common knowledge to humans in a computational model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creativity\n",
    "    Language is not just rule based. there is also creativity to it. various style, dialects, geners and variation are used in any language eg: Poem\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diversity across languages\n",
    "    For most language ther is no direct mapping between the vocabularies of any two language. it make nlp solution harder. eithe nlp model needs to be languge agonistic or needs to be developed foe each and every language."
