    "Transform a pre-processed text into suitable numerical form and fed into ML algorithm for further process is called feature extraction or text representation.\n",
    "Feature extraction is common step in any ml problem such as image, video, audio. \n",
    "\n",
    " - Images will be transform into matrix representation based on their pixel values.\n",
    " - Video also similar, video is just a collection of frames where each frame is an image.  so the video represent as a sequential collection of matrices. \n",
    " - Audio usually transmit as waves. so represent this mathematically, sampled wave amplitude will be \n",
    "recorded. this will give array representation of the sound waves.\n",

    "Text representation approach classified into 4 categories\n",
    "\n",
    " - Basic vectorization approaches\n",
    " - Distributed representations\n",
    " - Universal language representation\n",
    " - Handcrafted Features\n",

    "##### Text which represent by vectors of numbers is called vector space model. It's simple model used for representing any text blob. It's fundamental to many NLP operations like info-retrieval, scoring the documents etc.,  "
