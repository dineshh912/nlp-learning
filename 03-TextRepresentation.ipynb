    "    Feature extraction is an important step in machine learning problem. Conversion of raw text to a suitable numerical form is called text representation. \n",

    "    Feature representation is a common step in any ML Project. \n",
    "        * For example for images the data(oixel value) can be stored in the form of matrix.\n",
    "        * video also similar like image, since video is nothing but collection of image, it can be represent as a sequential collection of matrices. \n",
    "        * Speech - transmitted as a wave. we sample the wave and record it's amplitude(height). THis will give numerical repersentation in fixed time intervals.\n",

    "    Text representation classified into four categories:\n",
    "        * Basic vectorization approaches\n",
